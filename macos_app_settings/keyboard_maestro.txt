Download "keyboard_maestro_macros.kmmacros" (located in the same folder as this text file).
Delete all existing macro groups.
File > Import Macros Disables... > (locate the keyboard_maestro_macros.kmmacros file)
Enable all the imported macros.

This will add the following macros:

  Global Macros:
    F20: New Google Search in a new Chrome tab
    Cmd + F20: New YouTube Search in a new Chrome tab
    Alt + F20: New PyTorch Search in a new Chrome tab
    (note: I map Caps Lock to F20 using Karabiner.)

  PyCharm Macros:
    Cmd + Left: Home
    Cmd + Right: End
    Shift + Delete: Alt + Delete, Delete, Space
    (note: Home and End work better than the Cmd + Left/Right in PyCharm's terminal, and I use Shift + Delete to clear the line and go the end of the previous line.)

Also, go to Keyboard Maestro > Preferences...
