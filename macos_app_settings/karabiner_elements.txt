Place "karabiner.json" (located in the same folder as this text file) in the following location on your Mac: ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json

This will remap the following keys:
  Caps Lock: F20 (used by Keyboard Maestro to trigger a Google search)
  Cmd + I: Up
  Cmd + K: Down
  Cmd + J: Left
  Cmd + L: Right
  Cmd + U: Alt + Left
  Cmd + O: Alt + Right
  Cmd + H: Cmd + Left
  Cmd + ;: Cmd + Right
  Cmd + ': Cmd + Right

I set both "Cmd + ;" and "Cmd + '" to "Cmd + Right" because I seem to use both of them intuitively in different situations.

Also, go to "Karabiner-Elements Preferences > Devices", and under Caps Lock LED, uncheck all Manipulate LED options.
