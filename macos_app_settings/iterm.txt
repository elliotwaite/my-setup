To import settings:
  1. Place "com.googlecode.iterm2.plist" (located in the same folder as this
     text file) in any empty folder on your Mac (e.g. ~/Downloads).
  2. Then go to [iTerm2 > Preferences... > General > Preferences] and:
     * Check the "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL".
     * Select the folder used above (e.g. "~/Downloads").
  3. Then quit and restart iTerm2. The preferences should now be loaded and the
     colors should look different.
  4. Go back into [iTerm2 > Preferences... > General > Preferences] and:
     * Uncheck the "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL"
  5. Then you can delete the "com.googlecode.iterm2.plist" file.

To save settings:
  1. Go to [iTerm2 > Preferences... > General > Preferences] and:
     * Check the "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL".
     * Select the folder where you want the preferences saved
       (e.g. "~/Downloads").
     * Select "Save changes [Manually]", and click "Save Now".
  2. The generated settings file, "com.googlecode.iterm2.plist", will be saved
     to the output folder. You can then copy it into the same folder as this
     text file to overwrite the previously saved settings file.
