Place "com.googlecode.iterm2.plist" (located in the same folder as this text file) in any empty folder on your Mac (ex. ~/Downloads/temp) Then in the preferences (iTerm2 > Preferences... > General > Preferences), check the "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL", and select the "~/Downloads" folder. Then quit and restart iTerm2. The preferences should now be loaded and the colors should look different. The go back into the settings and uncheck "load preferences from a custom folder or URL". Then you can delete that folder (~/Downloads).
