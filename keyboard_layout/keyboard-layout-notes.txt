This keyboard layout is the standard macOS "U.S." keyboard layout, but with all
the "alternate" keys disabled, meaning that pressing `alt + some_key` will
output `some_key` instead of some alternative character, and most importantly,
none of the `alt + some_key` mappings will map to a dead key which prevents that
`alt + some_key` combo from being used as a keybinding in IDEs.

I created the "U.S. (without alternate keys)" keyboard layout by downloading and
installing Ukelele (https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) and then following these
steps:
1. Set the current macOS keyboard layout to "U.S.".
2. Open Ukelele and select: File > New From Current Input Source
3. Changed all the "alternative" keys (the keys that are shown when the alt key
   is held down) to be the same key as when alt is not held down, and change all
   dead keys to output keys.
4. Select: File > Save...
   - Save as: U.S. (without alternate keys).bundle
   - Where: ~/Library/KeyboardLayouts/
   - Click "Save"

Or you can install it by copying the the bundle file in this repo to
`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.

After the bundle file is installed, you may need to log out and log back in
before you are able to select the keyboard layout.

To select the keyboard layout:

1. Go to: System Settings > Keyboard > Text Input > Input Sources > and click
   "Edit...".
2. Click the "+" button in the bottom right corner of the window.
3. Select "English" (the top item) from the left menu, and "U.S. (without
   alternate keys)" from the right menu.
4. Click "Add".
5. Click "Done".
6. And then select the keyboard layout from the top macOS menu bar.
